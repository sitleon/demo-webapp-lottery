## Requirement

We are building a web-based lottery system.

In this system, we are selling tickets and perform the draws continuously and periodically.

After the previous draw, contestants can start to participate in the next draw.

Our system will generate a **random number/string** and assign it as **1** ticket per contestant.

Every ticket is unique and its identity should be generated by system.

Every **`x`** seconds there will be a draw and there will be only **1** winner.

And the system will response to contestants whether they win or not after the draw.

All tickets in 1 draw will be discarded once said draw is completed.
